# WEEK7: Soldering arduino onto the PCB

## 1. Get the PCB ready
- Get the eletronic components from the teacher
- Attach the paster to the the behind of the board. On the paster, there are the position notes of the componets to help us soldering.

## 2. Soldering 
- Although I practiced a few times before, the teacher taught me a better way. i.e. put the welding gun onto the desired position and heat up the position. Then put tin onto the proper position and it will automatically attach to it.

## 3. Test the arduino
- Before we can burn normal arduino program, we should burn the boot program (like BIOS) onto the IC.
- Also, since the copper on the board may be oxidized and the connectivity of the circuit.So we may need to test the conductivity of certain lines and add more tin to make the circuit work.
